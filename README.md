# Todo App

In the busy world of technology, staying organized is key to productivity and efficiency. To address this need, I've developed an innovative Todo App designed exclusively for Android devices. This app is a full-stack mobile application created using Flutter framework integrated with SQL Server for database management seamlessly and Web API built with .NET 8 as the backend. It has an easy-to-use design and many useful features to help you manage your tasks.

Key Features of the Todo App
1. Task Addition

One of the fundamental features of the Todo App is the ease with which users can add tasks. The intuitive design ensures that adding a task is straightforward and can be done with just a few taps on the screen. 

2. Task Editing

Flexibility is crucial when managing tasks, and the Todo App offers robust editing capabilities. Users can easily modify any existing task. The editing functionality ensures that the task list is always up-to-date and reflects the user's current priorities and schedule.

3. Task Deletion

Managing a to-do list often involves removing tasks that are no longer relevant or have been completed. The Todo App simplifies this process with an easy-to-use delete feature. Users can quickly remove tasks with a simple swipe or tap.

4. Automatic Deletion of Completed Tasks

To further enhance task management, the Todo App includes an automatic deletion feature for completed tasks. Once a task is marked as completed, it will be automatically removed from the task list after a predefined duration. It is particularly beneficial for users who prefer to keep their task list concise and focused on upcoming tasks.
